# SWOT

# Strengths

- sites - the trail leads to or passes probably *thousands* of sites across the country, whether heritage sites, natural parks or other interesting spots. 
- there is a compelling story of devoted and organized local groups and volunteers, as well as national organizatons who have chipped in or rolled up their sleeves (i.e. Canadian Military Engineers bridge-building)

# Weaknesses

- story: the story of the trail lacks coherence. What does unity mean? 
- general lack of visibility, both on the trail, on approaches to the trail, or as something in tourist and outdoors guides 

# Opportunities



# Threats

- 

# assets

- story


- wayfinding information (spurs and other decision points, portage-markings on blue routes)
- interpretation

# liabilities 

- donor recognition 
- sponsor recognition
